<p>Measuring the impact of a great culture on the company’s profits is difficult. The effects go beyond the numbers on the report. But just because it's difficult to measure, doesn't mean it should be neglected. The culture affects <strong>engagement, motivation, and trust</strong>.</p>

<p>Once you realize the importance of the organizational culture, the next obstacle to overcome is the fact that there is <strong>no easy fix</strong>. There are no exact steps that you can follow and process that you can enforce and make everything work.</p>

<p>This is not a to-do list. This is a <strong>leadership test</strong>. It is hard, but avoiding it is irrational. The worst case scenario is that nothing will change. On the other hand, if you do it right, you will have a workplace where people will feel <strong>respected, valued, trusted and engaged</strong>. It doesn’t take statistics or accounting reports to figure out which one is going to be more effective.</p>
