<p>Facebook's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, <a href="http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/facebook-sheryl-sandberg-can-leave-early-why-arent-you.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leaves work at 5:30PM</a>. Working longer hours does not always mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you're going to get more stuff done</a>.</p>
<p>Don't confuse effort with results. Also, don't confuse time with productivity. Productive people get things done in less time, not more.</p>
<p>Here's 5 ways to maximize your productivity:</p>
<h3>1. Learn to say no</h3>
<p>The fastest way to be done with the task is to not do it at all. Learn to say no to things that don't matter. Reevaluate your commitments regularly.</p>
<h3>2. Do the right thing</h3>
<p>Know the difference between <a href="http://www.elitecoaching.us/how-to-overcome-procrastination-by-prioritizing-properly">urgent and important</a>. Make a decision. Not everything can be high priority.</p>
<h3>3. Timeboxing</h3>
<p>Once you decide what you want to do, use the Pomodoro technique to limit how much time you have available. This will force you to focus, and make it easier for you to get in the flow.</p>
<h3>4. Discipline</h3>
<p>Let's say you want to write a book. An average book <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/book-length_n_1334636.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has 64,000 words</a>. If you were to write 500 words (around 2 pages - not that much!) every day, you would be done in 4 months! In a year, you would write 3 books!!!</p>
<h3>5. Health</h3>
<p>Being healthy will make you feel better, look better and be more confident.</p>
<p>Eating too much will make you tired. Have many smaller meals throughout the day, and avoid sugar.</p>
<p>Sleeping too little will hurt your creativity. Know how much sleep you need, and make sure you get that much sleep every night. If you need to wake up early, go to bed early. As simple as that.</p>
<p>Exercise will boost your energy and improve your mood. Do it a couple of days a week, even if it's only for 15 minutes and very soon you will notice a difference in how you feel.</p>
