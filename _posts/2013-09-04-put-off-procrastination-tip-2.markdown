<p>Procrastination can't be avoided. You can only do a limited number of things at any given moment, and the rest will need to be postponed. Of course, choosing the tasks that are more important than others can be a challenge. It is very important to make this choice consciously, and not just go with the flow. Be aware of this choice and you will make better decisions already.</p>
<p>Not all of us share the same values, so we can't come up with a list of values that will work for everybody, but I do invite you to make this list for yourself. You need to get clear on what matters to you and not get caught up in the details.</p>
<p>Another thing that I want you to perfect is to recognize the difference between urgent and important. Many people don't differentiate the two, or say they do but don't apply it. Every item on your todo list should be marked as urgent, important, both urgent and important or neither urgent nor important. Obviously, the tasks that are both urgent and important need to be worked on first, and tasks that are neither need to be worked on last. The tasks that are important, but not urgent, usually take precedence over tasks that are just urgent. The reason why is because if the task is not important, then the urgency is just a distraction that appears important.</p>
<p>What I'd like you to do today is look at your todo list (or create one if you don't have it written down) and mark each task as urgent and/or important. You can use letters U and I right next to the task description. Then sort the list according to the rules we talked about: both urgent and important go first, followed by just important, then we have just urgent and finally, neither urgent nor important. This is the order in which you should start working on your tasks.</p>
