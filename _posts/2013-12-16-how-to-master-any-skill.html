<p>I'm a Toastmasters member. For those that don't know, Toasmasters is a club whose purpose is improving your public speaking skills.</p>
<p>When making any type of decision, as part of the process, we commonly identify the return on investment. We evaluate the benefits, risks and investments to see if the commitment is worth the prize.</p>
<p>Mastering public speaking has many benefits. Public speaking develops your ability to communicate things clearly and concisely, not just when speaking to a group of people, but also in a one-on-one conversations.</p>
<p>It also improves your self-confidence. The Toastmasters club is a friendly and supportive environment, but still, before every speech, you get nervous. You start doubting yourself. "What if I mess up and embarass myself?"</p>
<p>Especially Table Topics. If you don't know how Table Topics work, this can be a little shocking to you: You are supposed to give a short speech without any preparation.</p>
<p>Scary, right?</p>
<p>The Table Topic Master gives you a topic and after that you have only a few seconds to think about it before you start speaking. Sometimes you are familiar with the topic and you have thought (or maybe even talked) about it before. But other times, you need to do all the thinking in those few seconds.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that knowing what to talk about is not all there is to it. You need to think about how you are going to express yourself, while observing the audience and taking their non-verbal feedback into account.</p>
<p>This teaches you to focus.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to be able to deliver an impromptu speech succesfully, realize that nervousness can be converted to positive energy. This approach builds your confidence and self esteem. It gets easier every time.</p>
<p>What's also very interesting is that when doing a table topic for the first time, a lot of people do a great job, but when talking to them afterwards, they think they sucked.</p>
<p>Instead, be proud of yourself for overcoming the fear.</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons you learn at Toastmasters is how to deal with fear. The fear loses its power when you realize that you speak in public all the time anyway. You talk to people at work, your family and your friends, and you don't fret over what you're going to say next or what's going to happen if you say something stupid.</p>
<p>In concluding this blog post, I'd like to ask you to realize that you may apply this strategy to the areas other than public speaking, as well.</p>
<p>1. Find a low risk environment and commit to practicing the skill on a consistent basis</p>
<p>2. Prepare the best you can, and find excitement in the things you can't predict</p>
<p>3. Learn from other people's feedback and self-reflection </p>
<p>Now pick a skill you would want to master and give it a try. Good luck!</p>
