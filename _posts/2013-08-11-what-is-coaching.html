<p>I've received a lot of questions about my coaching  business: what it is and how does it work and why did I decide to do it so I decided to make a blog post about it because I believe that my story will empower and inspire you to open the door to the opportunity that is present in your own life that you may have been putting off. </p>
<p>What is coaching? Coaching is an activity during which a coach helps clients identify personal goals and design an effective strategy to reach them. In life we constantly make decisions. Even if you don't do anything, you are still making a decision not to take action. The quality of our life is directly proportional to the quality of our decisions. That's why it's very important to consciously recognize your opportunities and align them with your needs and wants. But what is it that prevents us from achieving our goals? The most common obstacles are fear and frustration.</p>
<p>The coaching process provides you with the tools and techniques to overcome fear, and break through your limiting beliefs and get that life you deserve. Applying coaching principles can transform your life. In my sessions I go even a step further and teach you these principles so you can apply them yourself in the future. We all know the saying "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime".</p>
<p>I've spent many years of my life studying the fields of personal development and psychology. I started because I wanted to better understand myself and the world around me. My insatiable desire to improve myself accelerated my personal growth, and I was in the state of immense happiness. But then I realized that to remain happy one needs to keep growing, and if you constrain the growth to yourself, sooner or later you will realize that to get past that point, you need to give back. I didn't realize it until later, when I became aware of how much I have been helping the people in my environment, my friends, without ever asking for anything in return. Seeing them change their states from feeling sad, depressed and confused to being determined, happy and in control of their own lives was the greatest gift I could ever get.</p>
<p>And one day I realized how much meaning I find in the things I have been doing and how most people need someone to prevent them from letting their limiting beliefs slowly erode and eventually destroy their dreams. We don't do this consciously, we just get caught up in everyday life, ignoring the inner voice that's telling us what it is that we really want and refuse to admit to others or worse yet ourselves that we are ready for a change. I deeply believe that we all have capacity for making this change happen. The question is not "Can you", but "Will you". The only way out is through, so stop making excuses. Acknowledge your own needs and don't be afraid of overcoming your fears!</p>
<p>My own coach opened my eyes when she showed me how much passion and drive was locked up inside of me and how much energy was wasted on the inner conflicts I used to have. Once I resolved them, I felt so powerful that I felt that the fears I was having had to give way to the new me, the true me. And this incredible feeling of integrity challenged me to make this change in others.</p>
