<p>If you feel like you need to do something, or that you <strong>should</strong> do something, but don't really <strong>want</strong> to, there is a conflict inside of you.</p>
<p>One part of you thinks it's best for you to go ahead and do the task, but another part resists that thought, and wants to do something else (or nothing at all).</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself. Why do you think you should do it? What happens if you don't? Free yourself up from this obligation and convince yourself that <strong>you have a choice</strong>. If you don't do anything, will the world come to an end? If you don't take action, what's going to happen tomorrow? What about a week later? A month later? Year, 5 years? Will the pain grow in intensity, or will it vanish? What will happen to the reason you are doing this in the first place?</p>
<p>Now let's switch things a little. What if you do take action? What pain will you endure? How long will this pain last? Is this pain long lasting, or is it just temporary? What is it exactly that's stopping you from taking action?</p>
<p>Keep asking yourself why, and drill deeper and deeper with each question. Get to the bottom of this. <strong>Tell yourself the truth, no matter what.</strong></p>
