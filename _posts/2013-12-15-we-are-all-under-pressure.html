<p>A single woman with no kids in her late 20s who is constantly asked "Have you met anybody?" or "When are you going to have kids?" is under a lot of pressure. So is a man who worked hard to save up enough money and now wants to take a risk of quitting his day job and starting his own company.</p>
<p>Family and friends are well intentioned. They want you to be happy. But the problem is that their expectations might not match yours.</p>
<p>Most people offer advice based on their values, not yours. Instead of trying to understand you and support you, they want to tell you what they would do if they were in your situation, ignoring your individual needs and beliefs.</p>
<p>This lack of perspective on their side makes the existing process of going through a change (or not wanting to go through a change) more difficult and painful.</p>
<p>So how do you deal with it?</p>
<p>1. Get clear on what you want and stick with it. Believe in yourself. Be patient.</p>
<p>2. Surround yourself with supportive people.</p>
<p>3. Don't worry too much about people who don't get you. If they truly care about you, they will respect your decisions regardless, since all they really want to see at the end of the day, is you being happy.</p>
