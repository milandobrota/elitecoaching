<p>You feel pain for a reason: Your body is letting you know that something needs to be changed. It makes you aware of a problem.</p>
<p>Often times, the pain teaches you a lesson.</p>
<p>If you try to avoid pain, you may <strong>never learn the lesson</strong>. I'm not talking just about physical pain. Emotional pain can be avoided as well, by distracting yourself or using drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>Sometimes people <strong>learn the wrong lesson</strong>. I tore the ACL in my right knee playing basketball - maybe I should've never played? If a woman gets cheated on, are all men unfaithful? If you are not happy with your past, should you give up on your future?</p>
<p>Pain can <strong>make you a better person</strong>. You may know some great people who experienced a lot of pain in their lives. It is much easier for you to understand how another person feels if you've felt that way before. Be careful, though, every situation is different - don't assume too much too early.</p>
<p>The saying goes: "If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger." If you've experienced a tremendeous amount of pain in the past, the present and future might look less scary, because the new pain will be insignificant in comparison to the old pain.</p>
<p>The alternative is to get scared of the additional pain or start feeling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">helpless</a>. You decide.</p>
<p>Pain can be a very strong <strong>driving force</strong>. Have you ever said to yourself (or heard someone else say) in frustration: "I've had enough!" At that point, the pain reached the level at which it can't be tolerated anymore. The point at which frustration and anger become a promise to yourself that the pain of taking action can not be nearly as bad as the pain of the status quo.</p>
