<p>Last week I went to see <strong>Jason Fried</strong>, the co-founder of 37 Signals, give a talk about their ideology and reasons for their success. Here are some things he shared:</p>
<p><strong>Be patient.</strong> We see companies like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram achieve overnight success (or what looks like overnight success), and believe that is the norm, while in reality, those companies are lottery winners. Most companies grow at a much slower rate.</p>
<p><strong>Do not raise money.</strong> Bootstrap. This will teach you how to <strong>make</strong> money, instead of how to <strong>spend</strong> money. Furthermore, you will have the freedom to make decisions and control the timeline without the pressure from investors who want their money back quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Focus on the long term.</strong> The companies that stay in business for a long time are automatically successful. They survived, which means they found something that works. After being in the industry for such a long time, their experience helps them make better decisions.</p>
<p>What will you customers or clients want in <strong>10 years</strong>, but <strong>also want it now</strong>? Amazon customers won't ever say: "I wish that shipping took longer or was more expensive."</p>
<p><strong>Focus on what matters</strong>, and focus on it now.</p>
<p><strong>Hire remote workers.</strong> In some industries, this may not be possible, but in software development, there is no reason for a company to miss on the best talent available just because they aren't in the 30 mile radius. Similarly, the employee should be able to live wherever he or she wants and work for a company of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing is not a department.</strong> Marketing is everything you do. At 37 Signals, marketing is everybody's responsibility. Every blog post and tweet is obviously marketing, as well as every communication with a client and the product that you create.</p>
<p>Culture is not what you <strong>say</strong> you do, but what you end up <strong>doing</strong>. It is not what <strong>should</strong> be, but what <strong>is</strong>.</p>
<p>Evaluate people based on the <strong>value</strong> they produce, and not by how many <strong>hours</strong> they put in.</p>
<p>The best way to motivate employees is to give them work they find <strong>meaningful</strong>. This will motivate them intrinsically and make them productive and loyal. Somebody else can always give them more money or offer better perks, so don't rely on these extrinsic motivational factors (but do pay above market rates).</p>
<p>If you have an idea you would like to work on, <strong>do it</strong>! Start small and see how it goes.<br />
A few hours a week may be enough. That way, you can give your project a shot, but if it doesn't work out, it won't be too big of a deal.</p>
