<h3>What is the GROW model?</h3>

<p>The GROW model is used for setting goals. It helps you clarify the goal and figure out the plan of action. I use it very frequently in my coaching sessions.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The GROW model is basically a series of questions. GROW stands for Goal, Reality, Obstactles, Way forward.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>First, you need to identify what you are trying to achieve. Make sure your goal is <strong>SMART</strong> (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time bound).</p>
<p>Being as <strong>specific</strong> as possible makes it easier to plan and you will prevent your goal from changing during the process (unless you want to, of course).</p>
<p>If your goal is <strong>measurable</strong>, you will know how far along you are at any point, and you will know when you've reached it.</p>
<p>If you didn't think the goal was <strong>attainable</strong> you would get discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant</strong> goals fit into the bigger picture. How does this goal support who you want to become?</p>
<p><strong>Time bound</strong> goals have a deadline that forces you to take action. In coaching, the deadline is always set by the client, but the coach should confirm with the client that the deadline is realistic.</p>
<p>Also, try to identify the emotions that you will feel once you achieve this goal. This will help you gain clarity around why you want it and make you excited and motivated.</p>

<h3>Reality</h3>
<p>Once the goal is set, you need to ask yourself where you are right now. What does your current reality look like?</p>
<p>What is missing from your current situation?</p>
<p>What have you done in the past? What did you learn from it?</p>
<p>What resources do you already have? What other resources do you need?</p>

<h3>Obstacles</h3>
<p>The next step is to identify what can get in your way. Make sure that the obstacles are realistic.</p>

<h3>Way forward</h3>
<p>Brainstorming time!</p>
<p>What are your options? What are the pros and cons of each option?</p>
<p>Which one are you going to choose? How will this action help you get closer to your end goal?</p>
<p>It is very important that you don't stop here. You need to make sure you're motivated enough to take action. If you lack motivation, you need to figure out why and work on that first.</p>
<p>Now you know what to do, make sure you commit to it. Be specific about when and how you're going to do it. If you have a coach, he or she will hold you accountable, if not, make sure you tell people around you what you're up to.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope the GROW model will help you achieve your goals more quickly.</p>
