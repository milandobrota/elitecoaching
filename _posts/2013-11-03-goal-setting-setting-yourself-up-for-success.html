<p>Make your <strong>long term goals</strong> big and compelling. You need a strong enough driver to make your efforts worthwhile.</p>
<p>Don't worry about how you are going to do it right away. Allow yourself to identify what you truly want first.</p>
<p>Once you realize what that is, <strong>brainstorm</strong>. Come up with a plan to make it happen.</p>
<p>Once you have the plan in place, set your <strong>daily goals</strong>. Contrary to your long term goals, daily goals should be very simple and easy to accomplish. Expecting too much causes resentment.</p>
<p>Tim Ferriss sets out to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://99u.com/articles/7252/tim-ferriss-on-the-creative-process-and-getting-your-work-noticed">write two crappy pages a day</a>. Overnight success is an illusion. It's always one small, simple step at a time.</p>
<p>Completing these simple daily goals will increase your confidence and momentum. Often times, you will find yourself doing more than expected, which will boost your morale and eventually create a more sustainable system.</p>
<p>Small steps lead to big success.</p>
