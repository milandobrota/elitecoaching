<p>Fear of rejection is one of the most common reasons why people don't follow through. You set a goal, and know <strong>intellectually</strong> what it takes to reach it, but you are <strong>afraid that it won't work</strong>, and that you will get embarassed and rejected.</p>
<p>If this sounds like you, perhaps it would be worth taking a moment to see exactly what it is you fear so much and how likely that is to occur.</p>
<p>What would need to happen for you to feel rejected? Define what actions the other person needs to take for you to feel rejected. Some people make it too easy for them to feel that way.</p>
<p>If you think your rejection is real, <strong>don't take it personally</strong>. Did the other person reject <strong>you</strong> or <strong>your work</strong>? Does he or she even know you well enough?</p>
<p>Are you afraid of criticism? If so, realize that even when other people criticize you, they are giving you their time and attention. You are something worth talking about. Many people will not care about what you have to say or do. And others will love and support your work and your actions.</p>
<p>Some people will be harsh for no obvious reason. Some people will be jealous. The reason why those people react in such a way is <strong>beyond your control</strong>. Don't worry about it too much.</p>
<p>Then there will be people who will disagree with what you have to say. This is also OK. That does not necessarily mean that you are wrong. It just means that what you created is not for them. Focus on the people who care and who support you.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>success is 99% failure</strong>. What seems to be an overnight success is usually years of hard work and rejection.</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey was told she was "unfit for TV."</p>
<p>Steve Jobs was fired from the company he started.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein couldn't speak until he was 4 years old.</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg got rejected from a film school three times.</p>
<p>The Beatles were dropped by their record label.</p>
<p>Vincent Van Gogh sold one painting in his lifetime to his friend.</p>
<p>Elvis Presley was fired after only one performance. They told him that he wasn't singing country "correctly."</p>
<p>Sylvester Stallone's script for Rocky got rejected 1500 times.</p>
<p>Seth Godin got 900 rejection letters in a row from book publishers.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan was told that he was not good enough for his high school basketball team. He also stated later in his career: "I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot, and I missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeeded."</p>
<p>The list goes on. These celebrities are just human beings, just like you. They weren't chosen to be succesfull, they worked hard to get there. <strong>Be confident, be consistent and don't give up</strong>. Not all people will believe in you, but ultimately that doesn't matter, as long as you do. So what's your excuse?</p>
