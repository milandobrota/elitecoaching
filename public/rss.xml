      <title>Have Strong Enough Whys</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel like you need to do something, or that you &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; do something, but don't really &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; to, there is a conflict inside of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of you thinks it's best for you to go ahead and do the task, but another part resists that thought, and wants to do something else (or nothing at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be honest with yourself. Why do you think you should do it? What happens if you don't? Free yourself up from this obligation and convince yourself that &lt;strong&gt;you have a choice&lt;/strong&gt;. If you don't do anything, will the world come to an end? If you don't take action, what's going to happen tomorrow? What about a week later? A month later? Year, 5 years? Will the pain grow in intensity, or will it vanish? What will happen to the reason you are doing this in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's switch things a little. What if you do take action? What pain will you endure? How long will this pain last? Is this pain long lasting, or is it just temporary? What is it exactly that's stopping you from taking action?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep asking yourself why, and drill deeper and deeper with each question. Get to the bottom of this. &lt;strong&gt;Tell yourself the truth, no matter what.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Are You Made Of?</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a reward for your accomplishments. It is not a title or job description. And most certainly, it is not something that can be given to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Power, maybe. But leadership? No. Leadership is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, you have a decision to make. How hard are you willing to push to make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much do you care? About the cause, about the amazing things you can create, about the people you can help and whose lives you can change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much do you care? About the opportunity that is most likely right there, in front of you. Are you going to take the challenge? Or are you going to hide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but there is no map, no instructions and no guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a game of vulnerability, courage and patience. Do you care enough to keep going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When times get tough, when you get discouraged, overwhelmed and hurt, do you start coming up with excuses, start procrastinating or do you fearlessly keep going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you get criticized, rejected, and laughed at, or when no one is paying attention, do you get desperate, depressed or angry or do you proudly keep going, keep pushing, and keep making progress?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this really you? Or are you are doing it just for the applause?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this message excite you or scare you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's your excuse? Do you think that others don't need your work or that you are not good enough?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The GROW Model</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is the GROW model?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GROW model is used for setting goals. It helps you clarify the goal and figure out the plan of action. I use it very frequently in my coaching sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GROW model is basically a series of questions. GROW stands for Goal, Reality, Obstactles, Way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Goal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to identify what you are trying to achieve. Make sure your goal is &lt;strong&gt;SMART&lt;/strong&gt; (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time bound).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being as &lt;strong&gt;specific&lt;/strong&gt; as possible makes it easier to plan and you will prevent your goal from changing during the process (unless you want to, of course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your goal is &lt;strong&gt;measurable&lt;/strong&gt;, you will know how far along you are at any point, and you will know when you've reached it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't think the goal was &lt;strong&gt;attainable&lt;/strong&gt; you would get discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevant&lt;/strong&gt; goals fit into the bigger picture. How does this goal support who you want to become?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time bound&lt;/strong&gt; goals have a deadline that forces you to take action. In coaching, the deadline is always set by the client, but the coach should confirm with the client that the deadline is realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, try to identify the emotions that you will feel once you achieve this goal. This will help you gain clarity around why you want it and make you excited and motivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the goal is set, you need to ask yourself where you are right now. What does your current reality look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is missing from your current situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have you done in the past? What did you learn from it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What resources do you already have? What other resources do you need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Obstacles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to identify what can get in your way. Make sure that the obstacles are realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Way forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your options? What are the pros and cons of each option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one are you going to choose? How will this action help you get closer to your end goal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very important that you don't stop here. You need to make sure you're motivated enough to take action. If you lack motivation, you need to figure out why and work on that first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you know what to do, make sure you commit to it. Be specific about when and how you're going to do it. If you have a coach, he or she will hold you accountable, if not, make sure you tell people around you what you're up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sincerely hope the GROW model will help you achieve your goals more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Important Is Culture in Your Organization</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measuring the impact of a great culture on the company’s profits is difficult. The effects go beyond the numbers on the report. But just because it's difficult to measure, doesn't mean it should be neglected. The culture affects &lt;strong&gt;engagement, motivation, and trust&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you realize the importance of the organizational culture, the next obstacle to overcome is the fact that there is &lt;strong&gt;no easy fix&lt;/strong&gt;. There are no exact steps that you can follow and process that you can enforce and make everything work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a to-do list. This is a &lt;strong&gt;leadership test&lt;/strong&gt;. It is hard, but avoiding it is irrational. The worst case scenario is that nothing will change. On the other hand, if you do it right, you will have a workplace where people will feel &lt;strong&gt;respected, valued, trusted and engaged&lt;/strong&gt;. It doesn’t take statistics or accounting reports to figure out which one is going to be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overcoming Fear of Rejection</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.elitecoaching.us/img/strength.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;strength&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Photo by: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kozzi.com/stock-photo-24953983-kid-on-sea%2C-silhouette.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jasmin Merdan&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of rejection is one of the most common reasons why people don't follow through. You set a goal, and know &lt;strong&gt;intellectually&lt;/strong&gt; what it takes to reach it, but you are &lt;strong&gt;afraid that it won't work&lt;/strong&gt;, and that you will get embarassed and rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, perhaps it would be worth taking a moment to see exactly what it is you fear so much and how likely that is to occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would need to happen for you to feel rejected? Define what actions the other person needs to take for you to feel rejected. Some people make it too easy for them to feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think your rejection is real, &lt;strong&gt;don't take it personally&lt;/strong&gt;. Did the other person reject &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;your work&lt;/strong&gt;? Does he or she even know you well enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you afraid of criticism? If so, realize that even when other people criticize you, they are giving you their time and attention. You are something worth talking about. Many people will not care about what you have to say or do. And others will love and support your work and your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will be harsh for no obvious reason. Some people will be jealous. The reason why those people react in such a way is &lt;strong&gt;beyond your control&lt;/strong&gt;. Don't worry about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there will be people who will disagree with what you have to say. This is also OK. That does not necessarily mean that you are wrong. It just means that what you created is not for them. Focus on the people who care and who support you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, &lt;strong&gt;success is 99% failure&lt;/strong&gt;. What seems to be an overnight success is usually years of hard work and rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oprah Winfrey was told she was &quot;unfit for TV.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs was fired from the company he started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein couldn't speak until he was 4 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Spielberg got rejected from a film school three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beatles were dropped by their record label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Van Gogh sold one painting in his lifetime to his friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elvis Presley was fired after only one performance. They told him that he wasn't singing country &quot;correctly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvester Stallone's script for Rocky got rejected 1500 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin got 900 rejection letters in a row from book publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jordan was told that he was not good enough for his high school basketball team. He also stated later in his career: &quot;I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot, and I missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeeded.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list goes on. These celebrities are just human beings, just like you. They weren't chosen to be succesfull, they worked hard to get there. &lt;strong&gt;Be confident, be consistent and don't give up&lt;/strong&gt;. Not all people will believe in you, but ultimately that doesn't matter, as long as you do. So what's your excuse?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goal Setting: Setting Yourself Up For Success</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.elitecoaching.us/img/key-hole.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;key hole&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make your &lt;strong&gt;long term goals&lt;/strong&gt; big and compelling. You need a strong enough driver to make your efforts worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry about how you are going to do it right away. Allow yourself to identify what you truly want first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you realize what that is, &lt;strong&gt;brainstorm&lt;/strong&gt;. Come up with a plan to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the plan in place, set your &lt;strong&gt;daily goals&lt;/strong&gt;. Contrary to your long term goals, daily goals should be very simple and easy to accomplish. Expecting too much causes resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferriss sets out to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://99u.com/articles/7252/tim-ferriss-on-the-creative-process-and-getting-your-work-noticed&quot;&gt;write two crappy pages a day&lt;/a&gt;. Overnight success is an illusion. It's always one small, simple step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completing these simple daily goals will increase your confidence and momentum. Often times, you will find yourself doing more than expected, which will boost your morale and eventually create a more sustainable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small steps lead to big success.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Ways To Improve Your Productivity</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/shortest_path.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;productivity&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Photo by: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1018875&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sigurd Decroos&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/facebook-sheryl-sandberg-can-leave-early-why-arent-you.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaves work at 5:30PM&lt;/a&gt;. Working longer hours does not always mean &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;you're going to get more stuff done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't confuse effort with results. Also, don't confuse time with productivity. Productive people get things done in less time, not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's 5 ways to maximize your productivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Learn to say no&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to be done with the task is to not do it at all. Learn to say no to things that don't matter. Reevaluate your commitments regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Do the right thing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know the difference between &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elitecoaching.us/put-off-procrastination-tip-2&quot;&gt;urgent and important&lt;/a&gt;. Make a decision. Not everything can be high priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Timeboxing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you decide what you want to do, use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elitecoaching.us/pomodoro-technique-explained&quot;&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt; to limit how much time you have available. This will force you to focus, and make it easier for you to get in the flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Discipline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you want to write a book. An average book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/09/book-length_n_1334636.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has 64,000 words&lt;/a&gt;. If you were to write 500 words (around 2 pages - not that much!) every day, you would be done in 4 months! In a year, you would write 3 books!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being healthy will make you feel better, look better and be more confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating too much will make you tired. Have many smaller meals throughout the day, and avoid sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping too little will hurt your creativity. Know how much sleep you need, and make sure you get that much sleep every night. If you need to wake up early, go to bed early. As simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise will boost your energy and improve your mood. Do it a couple of days a week, even if it's only for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elitecoaching.us/put-off-procrastination-tip-1&quot;&gt;15 minutes&lt;/a&gt; and very soon you will notice a difference in how you feel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Put Off Procrastination - Tip #3: Avoid Perfectionism</title>
      <description>&lt;div class=&quot;photo-container&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/img/book.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;perfectionism&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Photo by: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.kozzi.com/stock-photo-25138981-bukas-na-aklat.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sergey Nivens&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stop being so hard on yourself! Demanding so much from yourself will make you want to stop before you even start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even if you manage to trick yourself into taking action, you will have trouble being happy with what you've created because you can always find something &quot;wrong&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop sabotaging yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying you should stop striving for quality in the products or relationships you create or the way you spend your time. That's not the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm saying is: &lt;b&gt;Don't ignore the positive things.&lt;/b&gt; If you constantly focus on what's missing, you will never be happy. Your brain will link your goals to pain and before you know it, you will give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, &lt;b&gt;learn to be happy&lt;/b&gt; even if things aren't perfect. Learn to value yourself more. Be proud of your hard work and pat yourself on the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the results are not there yet, don't worry. Over time, you will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don't Fall For These 3 Planning Mistakes</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;/img/planning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;planning&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mistake #1: Never being ready&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planning is great. But how much is too much? How can you stop over-planning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, you need to know what problem you are trying to solve. Why do we plan in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning provides us with the tactics and confidence. If you are not sure what you should do to make progress, you need to come up with the tactics. If you don't think you're good enough to do something, despite spending a lot of time preparing and working on your skills, you need to work on your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing can go a long way toward helping you become more confident, but achieving high levels of confidence will require that you perform the task. To be good at something, you need to do it. Not just read about it, or plan indefinitely. Start right now, or figure out exactly what you need to do before you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mistake #2: Planning too far ahead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much can you really predict? Not that much, really. So plan accordingly. You may feel confident about the things in the near future. Focus on your next move. You can try anticipating what might happen in the near future, but don't expect your plan to handle every possible variation years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is not the end goal. There is no guarantee of success. Don't be shortsighted. If you execute the plan perfectly, you did a great job following the plan, but don't be surprised if the results don't reflect your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mistake #3: Making no adjustments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality changes. The only constant thing in the world is change. What might be a good idea now, might not be a good idea later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just that. Reality is different from how we experience it. We all have our own &quot;reality&quot; and in our heads, a plan might work out perfectly, but the truth is, you won't know until you go ahead and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iterate! Make a reasonable plan and execute it. Then reflect on what worked and what didn't and adjust the sails accordingly. The success might come sooner than you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Put Off Procrastination - Tip #2: Prioritize Better</title>
      <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/qZDNFtKvdWo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procrastination can't be avoided. You can only do a limited number of things at any given moment, and the rest will need to be postponed. Of course, choosing the tasks that are more important than others can be a challenge. It is very important to make this choice consciously, and not just go with the flow. Be aware of this choice and you will make better decisions already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of us share the same values, so we can't come up with a list of values that will work for everybody, but I do invite you to make this list for yourself. You need to get clear on what matters to you and not get caught up in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I want you to perfect is to recognize the difference between urgent and important. Many people don't differentiate the two, or say they do but don't apply it. Every item on your todo list should be marked as urgent, important, both urgent and important or neither urgent nor important. Obviously, the tasks that are both urgent and important need to be worked on first, and tasks that are neither need to be worked on last. The tasks that are important, but not urgent, usually take precedence over tasks that are just urgent. The reason why is because if the task is not important, then the urgency is just a distraction that appears important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'd like you to do today is look at your todo list (or create one if you don't have it written down) and mark each task as urgent and/or important. You can use letters U and I right next to the task description. Then sort the list according to the rules we talked about: both urgent and important go first, followed by just important, then we have just urgent and finally, neither urgent nor important. This is the order in which you should start working on your tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
